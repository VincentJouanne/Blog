Testing is the art of **delegating the mental load to the machine** in order to:

- Have a quicker feedback loop
- Design your code
- Refactor safely
- Document the codebase

When you have a tested codebase you put yourself and your team on the road to success: **everyone works in a safe environment** backed up by "security nets".

But... what should we test ?

In this article **I will break down the 4 kinds of tests you can do in Flutter.**

You can find the implementation of each kind of test [in this Github repository](https://github.com/VincentJouanne/flutter-bloc-clean-architecture):

# Unit tests

I think **people fails at Unit tests because they focus on implementation details** rather than **focusing on business value** of the application: the use-cases.

Unit tests gather the following characteristics:

- Runs in-memory (< x0 ms)
- Spot functional regression
- Involves Use-cases and Domain layers
- Uses a fake Infrastructure

Use-cases are all the reads and writes of your application:

- Signup with credentials
- Signin with Google
- Retrieve current progression
- Save workout program
- etc.

You can find [an example here](https://github.com/VincentJouanne/flutter-bloc-clean-architecture/blob/master/app/test/features/authentication/bloc/signup_cubit_test.dart).

# Smoke tests

"Pschhhh" - a smoke test running.

Also known as Widget tests, they are focus on user interactions with the UI.

I like to write them with a BDD-style:

- **Given** an unknown user on the Signup page, **When** he enters a badly formatted email, **Then** he should see an error message.
- **Given** a well-known user on the Login page, **When** he enters his credentials in the login page, **Then** he should be redirected to the Home page.
- etc.

These tests has the following characteristics:

- Runs in-memory (< x00 ms)
- Spot functional regression
- Involves UI, Use-cases and Domain layers
- Uses a fake Infrastructure

<Image alt="second brain" src="/static/images/smoke-test-flutter.png" width={906} height={398} />

If you struggle to achieve the desired assertion, you may have a problem on one of your use-case: then, you can fallback to your unit tests :) !

You can find [an example here](https://github.com/VincentJouanne/flutter-bloc-clean-architecture/blob/master/app/test/features/authentication/ui/signup_success_test.dart)

# Snapshots tests

Known as "Golden tests", focused on the UI, they spot Visual regressions:

- Runs in-memory (< x00 ms)
- Spot visual regressions
- Involves UI

<Image alt="second brain" src="/static/images/golden-test-flutter.png" width={906} height={398} />

# E2E tests

Similarly to smoke tests, they are focus on the user interactions with the UI but they involves the real infrastructure implementation and runs on a device:

- Runs on a device ( < x000 ms)
- Spot functional regression
- Involves UI, Uses-cases, Domain, Infrastructure

<Image alt="second brain" src="/static/images/e2e-test-flutter.png" width={906} height={398} />

If you have used a BDD-style approach for your smoke tests with reusable steps, you should be able to write meaningful e2e tests in no-time :)

You can find [an example here](https://github.com/VincentJouanne/flutter-bloc-clean-architecture/blob/master/app/integration_test/features/authentication/src/authentication_test.dart)

# Wrap up

If you have this 4 kinds of test in your codebase, congratulations, you are sure to have one of the strongest test suite possible with Flutter !
